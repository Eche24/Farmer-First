          Using historical data available, we locate farming communities as well as 
          distinguish crops that have a proven track record of thriving well in these communities; 
          next we identify the key stakeholders as regards farming such crops,
           then the market potential and possible threats/challenges and potential local partners

        <p>We collate data and establish relationships with the farmers we have identified using our extension workers. 
          These farmers are grouped into clusters after which they are trained on best practices and the usage of simple semi-mechanized machinery.

        <p>Trained farmers are assigned to specialised lead farm agents. The farmers are provided with improved seeds, 
          semi-mechanized kits, and allocated farm lots on our fields situated in their communities.

        <p>At the end of any farming cycle, farmers do not have to worry about selling their products to consumers. We take that burden away by connecting them with established
           markets that purchase these products in manners that are not disadvantageous to these farmers..

        <p>Interested farmers and farm subscribers (investors) are paid using a digital ledger payment system (crypto-currency). 
          Furthermore, safe crypto investments portfolios are created for interested farmers which give additional funds to their pockets even during the off farming seasons. Available historical data of our farms (crops and animals) are made available to 
          consumers to further increase quality assurance and promote trust.
